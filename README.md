# O-Test

We developed a predictive model to gauge the impact a person's lifestyle has on their health, with the goal of preventing health risks that arise from obesity. This project was submitted to SB Hacks VII and was judged top 5 out of over 250 participants.

## Goal
Today, over 40% of Americans suffer from obesity. Obesity and excessive weight have been associated with severe risk of illness ([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/obesity-and-covid-19.html)). We find this problem especially relevant given the current COVID-19 pandemic, as many people have found themselves confined indoors with little to no exercise. By providing a predictive model to gauge the impact a person's lifestyle has on their health, we hope to aid in preventing health risks that arise from obesity and excessive weight.

## Tools and Frameworks
This project was created with a wide range of technologies. The frontend was developed using React, Firebase, Axios, and Material-UI. The backend consists of a REST service created with Flask and hosted on Google Cloud Platform. Our ML predictive model was crafted using NumPy, Scikit, and Pandas with a dataset acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ankurbajaj9/obesity-levels). It employs clustering and the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to make inferences from user input.
